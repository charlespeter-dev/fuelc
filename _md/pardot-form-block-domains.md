Yes, you can block certain domains from registering through a Pardot form that integrates with Salesforce. Here are a few methods to achieve this:

---

### 1. **Use Pardot Form Handlers (JavaScript Validation)**
You can add custom JavaScript to your Pardot form or form handler to validate the email domain before submission. If the domain is blocked, the form will not submit.

Example JavaScript:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const blockedDomains = ['example.com', 'blockeddomain.com']; // Add domains to block
    const emailField = document.getElementById('email'); // Replace with your email field ID

    document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
        const email = emailField.value;
        const domain = email.split('@')[1];

        if (blockedDomains.includes(domain)) {
            e.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission
            alert('This domain is not allowed to register.');
        }
    });
});
```

---

### 2. **Use Salesforce Validation Rules**
If the form data is being sent to Salesforce, you can create a validation rule on the Lead or Contact object to block specific domains.

Example Validation Rule:
- Object: Lead
- Error Condition Formula:
  ```text
  OR(
      CONTAINS(Email, '@example.com'),
      CONTAINS(Email, '@blockeddomain.com')
  )
  ```
- Error Message: "This domain is not allowed to register."

This will prevent records with blocked domains from being saved in Salesforce.

---

### 3. **Use Pardot Automation Rules**
You can create an automation rule in Pardot to handle submissions from blocked domains. For example:
- Create an automation rule that triggers when a prospect submits a form.
- Set a condition to check the email domain (e.g., `Email ends with @example.com`).
- Add an action to delete the prospect or mark them as "Do Not Email."

---

### 4. **Block Domains at the Email Level**
If you want to block domains from being used in Pardot altogether, you can add them to the **Suppression List** in Pardot:
- Go to **Marketing** > **Segmentation** > **Suppression Lists**.
- Add the domains you want to block.

This will prevent any email addresses from those domains from being added to Pardot.

---

### 5. **Use Salesforce Triggers (Apex)**
For more advanced control, you can write an Apex trigger in Salesforce to block specific domains when a Lead or Contact is created or updated.

Example Apex Trigger:
```apex
trigger BlockDomains on Lead (before insert, before update) {
    Set<String> blockedDomains = new Set<String>{'example.com', 'blockeddomain.com'};

    for (Lead lead : Trigger.new) {
        String emailDomain = lead.Email.substringAfter('@');
        if (blockedDomains.contains(emailDomain)) {
            lead.addError('This domain is not allowed to register.');
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 6. **Use Pardot Connector for Salesforce (Optional)**
If you're using the Pardot-Salesforce connector, ensure that your blocked domains are consistently enforced across both systems by combining the above methods.

By implementing one or more of these methods, you can effectively block specific domains from registering through your Pardot/Salesforce forms. Let me know if you need further clarification!
